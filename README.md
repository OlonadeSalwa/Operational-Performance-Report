# Operational Performance Report  
## OEE, Downtime & Production Analysis (Nov 2024 – Jan 2025)

### Prepared by: Salwa Olonade  
### Period Covered: November 2024 – January 2025

---

## 1. Objective
The objective of this report is to analyze the operational performance of selected production units using key manufacturing metrics such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), Downtime Percentage, Mill Utilization, and Target vs Actual Production.  
The analysis aims to identify performance trends, gaps, and improvement opportunities.

---

## 2. Scope of Analysis
The analysis covers the following production units:
- ASML
- ASM
- AFL Line A
- AFL Line B

Each unit was evaluated over a three-month period (November 2024 to January 2025).

---

## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were used for performance evaluation:
- *Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE %)*
- *Downtime (%)*
- *Mill Utilization (%)*
- *Target Production vs Actual Production*

These KPIs provide insight into equipment efficiency, availability, and production effectiveness.

---

## 4. Summary of Findings

### 4.1 Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
- OEE performance generally *improved in December* across all units.
- A noticeable *decline in OEE was observed in January*, indicating possible increases in downtime or reduced utilization.
- ASML recorded the *highest OEE values overall*, while ASM and AFL Line B showed relatively lower consistency.

---

### 4.2 Downtime Analysis
- Downtime levels varied across units, with *January showing higher downtime percentages* in most cases.
- Increased downtime directly impacted mill utilization and OEE performance.
- AFL Line A demonstrated relatively better downtime control compared to other units.

---

### 4.3 Mill Utilization
- Mill utilization followed a similar trend to OEE, peaking in December and declining in January.
- Reduced utilization in January suggests operational disruptions such as equipment breakdowns or maintenance-related delays.

---

### 4.4 Target vs Actual Production
- Across all units, *actual production consistently fell below target production*.
- The gap between target and actual output widened in January, aligning with the observed increase in downtime and reduced utilization.
- AFL Line B showed some recovery in OEE but still did not meet production targets.

---

## 5. Key Insights
- December recorded the *best overall operational performance* across most units.
- January performance decline highlights the need for *root cause analysis*, particularly around downtime drivers.
- Persistent gaps between target and actual production indicate opportunities for process optimization and preventive maintenance.

---

## 6. Recommendations
- Conduct a detailed *downtime root cause analysis* to identify major contributors to lost production.
- Implement *preventive maintenance strategies* to reduce unplanned equipment failures.
- Monitor OEE trends monthly and compare against a defined *OEE benchmark or target*.
- Align production planning more closely with equipment availability and utilization levels.

---

## 7. Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear overview of operational performance across selected production units. While performance improvements were observed in December, the decline in January highlights the importance of consistent monitoring, downtime control, and proactive maintenance.  
Addressing these areas can improve equipment efficiency, increase production output, and support overall operational excellence.
